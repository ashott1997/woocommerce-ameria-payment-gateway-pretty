# WooCommerce Ameriabank Payment Gateway Pretty


##### The plugin works with WooCommerce, the functionality is to add an additional payment option on checkout, using Ameriabank third-party payment system.

* This plugin allows you to add additional payment system in your WooCommerce website, using Ameriabank payment gateway.
* You can edit settings in dashboard here WooCommerce->Settings->Checkout and scroll to the bottom. After you should activate it and fill the settings.
* With this plugin you can put your credentials from admin side without single touch of a code.
* I also provided a testing mode in the plugin settings.
* If you want to test, check the testing mode checkbox in the settings page.
* When you install the plugin, you should fill the 'Order ID' field in settings. It is required and being done a single time.
* If you use testing mode, put in the 'Order ID' field something random (e.g. 896542)
* If you use the plugin for production mode then just put 1 (if you use your Ameriabank gateway first time) or your last order ID in Ameriabank VPOS system.
* If after pressing the payment button you're not allowed to pay, most times the problem is in the 'Order ID'. Try to put there another number.
* Client ID, Username and Password must be provided by Ameriabank.
* After all just install and use :)
* Updates and changes to the plugin are welcomed. If you have a proper edited code, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes.
